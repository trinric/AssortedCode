# AssortedCode
 Some random scripts that I enjoyed making.
BlindSpot was the code that would calculate the position of the sun just using a simple attached clock and latitude / longitude and no internet. It would then tell a stepper motor to adjust based on many factors such as eye height, the circumference of the spool attached to the blinds, etc. The majority of the time was spent on the math and calculations. The motor part came together fairly quickly once that was all ready.

DS and Voronoi were some code I wrote in my explorations of procedurally generated heightmaps. Voronoi diagrams are useful in many fields, and they just look cool. DS is a crude implementation of the diamond square algorithm.
